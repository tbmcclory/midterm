			<h2>The Mars Plan</h2>
			<h3>Is Spacex making multiplanitary life possible?</h3>

				Humans could set foot on Mars within the next 10 years -- at least if SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has his way.<br> 

				<br>The billionaire entrepreneur, who also happens to be the CEO of Tesla Motors, chairman of renewable energy company Solar City and co-founder of PayPal, today unveiled his ambitious plan for colonizing the Red Planet. <br>

				<br>His concept -- which he offhandedly admits amounts to a "fairly significant technical challenge" (it is rocket science, after all) -- involves building and launching a 400-foot carbon-fiber spacecraft, sending a reusable rocket to refuel it mid-orbit, then deploying the spaceship's built-in solar array and sending it off on a 3- to 4-month journey to Mars, only to be refueled by methane gas produced on Mars and sent back to Earth. <br>

				<br>Musk's so-called "interplanetary transport system" is designed to dramatically reduce the cost of the trip, currently estimated at around $10 billion per person, to just $200,000 or so per person, the 45-year-old explained at the International Astronautical Congress in Guadalajara, Mexico. Eventually, he hopes to build up a "fleet" of 1,000 or more, each carrying 100 to 200 passengers bound for a new life on Mars. <br>

				<br>In Musk's view, a self-sustaining Martian city could serve as humankind's insurance policy against a "doomsday event" which could out intelligent life on our home planet. <br>

				<br>But for those first intrepid explorers -- who Musk has repeatedly compared to Americaâ€™s early colonists -- the trip will be a perilous one.<br>

				<br>"Basically, are you prepared to die?" Musk asked. "If that's okay, you know, you're a candidate for going."<br>

				<br>Once you get over the fear of death, of course, "it'd be, like, really fun to go!" Musk said, noting that his plan includes movie screenings and lectures en route.<br>

				<br>Eventually, SpaceX wants to send a million people to Mars, a feat Musk believes they could achieve within about 100 years of the first manned mission, which could be launched as early as 2024.<br>

				<br>Building such a complex system will cost a lot of money -- so much that Musk hasn't yet named a dollar figure. But funding the dream is the main reason Musk is "personally accumulating assets," he said -- and once they make some progress, he hopes public support will "snowball."<br>

				<br>(Today's announcement, however, comes just weeks after a high-profile, dramatic explosion on the launch pad in Cape Canaveral, which destroyed one of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets and its payload. The company has since said a helium system breach is likely to blame for the "anomaly," and announced it would return to flight as early as November.)<br>

				<br>Travel to Mars "would be an incredible adventure," Musk mused. "I think it would be the most inspiring thing that I could possibly imagine."<br>
